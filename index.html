        After Malcom's mother suffered a mental breakdown, she was
        institionalized and her 9 children were split up amoung foster families.
        Though Malcolm did well in Junior High, Malcolm lost much interestin
        school and moved to Boston where he ran the streets and committed
        crimes. Just at the tender age of 21, Malcolm was arrested and sent to
        10 years in prison. While in prison, Malcolm's brother came to visit and
        told him of his conversion to Islam. Malcolm started to study more about
        the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, Nation of Islam (NOI). Thus Malcolm
        X's conversion started to take shape. While in prision Malcolm
        considered his last name (Little) a slave name and choose to the letter
        X as his preferred name. His new muslim name became el-Hajj Malik
        el-Shabazz. Malcolm X became a powerful speaker for the Nation of Islam
        (NOI) during the 50's and 60's.
